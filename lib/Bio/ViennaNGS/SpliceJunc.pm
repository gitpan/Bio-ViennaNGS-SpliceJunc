Bio::ViennaNGS::SpliceJunc - Perl extension for alternative splicing

  use Bio::ViennaNGS::SpliceJunc;
  use Bio::ViennaNGS::Fasta;

  # get a Bio::ViennaNGS::Fasta object
  my $fastaO = Bio::ViennaNGS::Fasta->new($fasta_in);

  # Extract annotated splice sites from BED12

  # Extract mapped splice junctions from RNA-seq data

  # Check for each splice junction seen in RNA-seq if it overlaps with
  # any annotated splice junction
  @res = intersect_sj($dest_annot,$dest_ss,$dest,$prefix,$window,$mil);

  # Convert splice junctions seen in RNA-seq data to BED12

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Bio::ViennaNGS::SpliceJunc> is a Perl module for alternative
splicing (AS) analysis. It provides routines for identification,
characterization and visualization of novel and existing (annotated)
splice junctions from RNA-seq data.

Identification of novel splice junctions is based on intersecting
potentially novel splice junctions from RNA-seq data with annotated
splice junctions.

=head2 SUBROUTINES

=over 3

=item bed6_ss_from_bed12($bed12,$dest,$window,$can,$fastaO)

Extracts splice junctions from a BED12 file (provided via argument
C<$bed12>), writes a BED6 file for each transcript to C<$dest>,
containing all its splice junctions. If C<$can> is 1, canonical splice
junctions are reported in the 'name' field of the output BED6 file.
Output splice junctions can be flanked by a window of +/- C<$window>
nt. C<$fastaO> is a L<Bio::ViennaNGS::Fasta> object. Each splice
junction is represented as two bed lines in the output BED6.

=item bed6_ss_from_rnaseq($bed_in,$dest,$window,$mcov,$can,$fastaO)

Extracts splice junctions from mapped RNA-seq data. The input BED6
file should contain coordinates of introns in the following syntax:

chr1    3913    3996    splits:97:97:97:N:P     0       +

The fourth column in this BED file (correponding to the 'name' field
according to the L<BED
specification|http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1>)
should be a colon-separated string of six elements, where the first
element should be 'splits' and the second element is assumed to hold
the number of reads supporting this splice junction. The fifth element
indicates the splice junction type: A capital 'N' determines a normal
splice junction, whereas 'C' indicates circular and 'T' indicates
trans-splice junctions, respectively. Only normal splice junctions
('N') are considered, the rest is skipped. Elements 3, 4 and 6 are not
further processed.

We recommend using
F<segemehl|http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/segemehl/> for
generating this type of BED6 files. This routine is, however, not
limited to F<segemehl> output. BED6 files containing splice junction
information from other short read mappers or third-party sources will
be processed if they are formatted as described above.

This routine writes a BED6 file for each splice junction provided in
the input to C<$dest>. Output splice junctions can be flanked by a
window of +/- C<$window> nt. Canonical splice junctions are reported
in the 'name' field of the output BED6 file if C<$can> is 1 nad
C<$featO> is a L<Bio::ViennaNGS::Fasta> object. Each splice junction
is represented as two bed lines in the output BED6. Only splice
junctions that are supported by at least C<$mcov> reads are reported.

=item bed6_ss_to_bed12($bed_in,$dest,$window,$mcov,$circ)

Produce BED12 output for splice junctions found in RNA-seq data. Input
BED6 files (provided via C<$bed_in>) are supposed to conform to the
F<segemehl|http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/segemehl/>
standard format for reporting splice junctions, which has the
following syntax:

chr1    3913    3996    splits:97:97:97:N:P     0       +

See L<bed6_ss_rom_rnaseq> for details.

C<$dest> is the output path. Output splice junctions can optionally be
flanked by a window of +/- C<$window> nt. Only splice junctions that
are supported by at least C<$mcov> reads are reported. If C<$circ> is
1, B<circular> splice junctions are reported (if present in the
input), else B<normal> splice junctions are processed.

=item intersect_sj($p_annot,$p_mapped,$dest,$prefix,$window,$mil)

Intersects all splice junctions identified in an RNA-seq experiment
with annotated splice junctions. Identifies and characterizes novel
and existing splice junctions. Each BED6 file in C<$p_mapped> is
intersected with those transcript splice junction BED6 files in
C<$p_annot>, whose genomic location spans the query splice
junction. This is to prevent the tool from intersecting each splice
site found in the mapped RNA-seq data with B<all> annotated
transcripts. C<$mil> specifies a maximum intron length.

The intersection operations are performed with F<bedtools intersect>
from the L<BEDtools|https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2> suite). BED
sorting operations are performed with F<bedtools sort>.

Writes two BED6 files to C<$dest> (optionally prefixed by C<$prefix>), which
contain novel and existing splice junctions, respectively.

=item ss_isCanonical($chr,$p5,$p3,$fo)

Checks whether a given splice junction is canonical, ie. whether the
first and last two nucleotides of the enclosed intron correspond to a
certain nucleotide motif. C<$chr> is the chromosome name, C<$p5> and
C<$p3> the 5' and 3' ends of the splice junction and C<$fo> is a
L<Bio::ViennaNGS::Fasta> object holding the underlying reference
genome

This routine does not explicitly consider standedness in the sense
that splice junction motifs are evaluated in terms of the forward
strand of the underlying reference sequence. This is best explained by
an example: Consider the splice junction motif GU->G on the reverse
strand. In 5' to 3' direction of the forward strandm this junction
reads CT->AC. A splice junction is canonical if its motif corresponds
to one of the following cases:

5'===]GT|CT....AG|AC[====3' ie GT->AG or CT->AC
5'===]GC|CT....AG|GC[====3' ie GC->AG or CT->GC
5'===]AT|GT....AC|AT[====3' ie AT->AC or GT->AT

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This modules depends on the following Perl modules:

=over

=item L<Bio::ViennaNGS>

=item L<Bio::ViennaNGS::Fasta>

=item L<IPC::Cmd>

=item L<Path::Class>

=item L<Carp>

=back

L<Bio::ViennaNGS::SpliceJunc> uses third-party tools for computing
intersections of BED files: F<bedtools intersect> from the
L<BEDtools|http://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/content/tools/intersect.html>
suite is used to compute overlaps and F<bedtools sort> is used to sort
BED output files. Make sure that those third-party utilities are
available on your system, and that hey can be found and executed by
the perl interpreter. We recommend installing the latest version of
L<BEDtools|https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2> on your system.
